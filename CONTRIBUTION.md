<h3>Few norms you can follow</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Proper intendation is must</li>
    <li>Proper commenting should be there to make code readable</li>
    <li>You may mention complexity of a function in comment</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Time complexity : </li>
        <li>Space complexity : </li>
      </ul>
    <li>Place your code in right directory</li>
    <li>Naming of your file must be proper and relevant</li>
  </ul>

<h4>Directory Structure Example</h4>
<p>please maintain the directory structure as in this example</p>

<h4>You may add your solved questions on spoj, codechef, hackerearth, hackerrank and codeforces.</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>First line of your code must begin with a comment mentioning the link of the question</li>
    <li>Place the solutions in seperate folder "ques" in relevant directory</li>
  </ul>

<h4>DESCRIPTION.md</h4>
  <p>If not already present, you are free to create a DESCRIPTION.md file in a folder </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Please write a brief description of your algorithm in DESCRIPTION.md file</li>
    <li>You can mention the following points:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Description of your algorithm</li>
        <li>Time and space complexity of your algorithm</li>
        <li>Links to your favourite online questions solvable by that algorithm</li>
          <ui>
            <li>You may also provide solution to that questions in "ques" folder in the same directory</li>
            <li>Also mention link of solution(if available) along with the question link</li>
          </ui>
      </ul>
  </ul>

<h4>Best Practice of creating a Pull Request</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The PR name should be meaningful.</li>
  <li>For e.g. 'Fixes #(issue-number): PR name, fixing the particular bug' (without commas)</li>
  <li>There should be always 1 commit for 1 PR</li>
  <li>If there are more than 1 commit in a PR, squash them.</li>
  <li>Pull Request details should be descriptive.</li>
  <li>Commit message should meaningful.</li>
</ul>
